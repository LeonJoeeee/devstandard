# 0015 — Agent teams mirror a human GitHub team: issues dispatch, PRs return, the ladder picks the executor

Status: Accepted (2026-07-09). Amended by 0045 (2026-09-05). Supersedes 0005. Amends 0007 (its
every-session budget, relaxed to carry the collaboration model inline) and 0009 (its "= one
session" invariant). Amended by 0022 (2026-07-24, small-change ceremony exemption). Amended

## Context

0005 fixed the parallel model as "one session = one branch = one worktree = one task." Three things push a refinement.

1. **"= one session" is the weakest link.** What is load-bearing is one-branch-one-worktree (isolation + clean integration); *who* executes inside is an execution-ladder choice, not a fixed identity. The rigid identity also contradicts 0009's own doctrine — sessions are mortal, and work must survive into another session.
2. **In practice the human does the core thinking with one persistent "main" session** (project definition, requirements drilling), and most tasks, once drilled, are baked enough to hand to a subagent or a workflow rather than a whole separate session — the cheapest rung that holds the work.
3. **Dispatch and hand-back had no durable substrate:** a worker's assignment lived in an ephemeral first prompt, and "who merges" was defined three incompatible ways across the docs.

## Decision

Model the agent team on a human GitHub team, on GitHub-native, durable artifacts:

1. **The main session is the cockpit** (human + Claude): core discussion, project definition, requirements drilling, dispatch, and integration decisions live here. It is the outer layer's single hub — it fans work out and fans it back in.
2. **Dispatch = a GitHub issue.** Work that earns a branch is filed as an issue: the durable, inspectable task spec carrying the done-check (replacing the ephemeral first prompt). A trivial in-repo change skips this — done in-session (the anti-ceremony floor, 0014).
3. **Executor = the cheapest ladder rung that holds the work** (the execution ladder, 0008). One task = one branch = one worktree; the executor inside is chosen, not fixed: trivial → the cockpit directly; baked/bounded → a subagent or workflow; too big to pre-specify (needs mid-flight steering) / long-running and parallel across time / another human's → a separate live session. "= one session" is retired as an invariant and becomes the top rung.
4. **Return = a PR** linked to the issue; the worker never writes main. While the author is live it rebases its own branch onto current main and resolves its own conflicts (it has the context); it never performs the merge. When the author is ephemeral (a subagent/workflow that ended at PR-open) and a later merge forces a conflicting re-rebase, the cockpit files it as a new bounded issue and dispatches a fresh worker — the rebase duty falls to whoever is live, never to a dead author.
5. **Integration is the cockpit's act as decision-maker.** For each PR it spawns a **fresh clean-context reviewer** (sees only the diff + the issue) — never grading its own work, never anchored by the cockpit's accumulated context — then green CI against current main (the two gates, 0011); then, with the human for judgment (good enough? touches architecture → human + ADR), it merges and closes the issue.
6. **Roles and boundaries are written down** so any executor knows them: you own your branch, you deliver a PR, you never merge or tag, your done-check is in the issue. A separate session learns this from injected `core.md`; a subagent, which gets no injection, learns it from `aids/worker-brief.md` pasted in at dispatch.

Surviving 0005 unchanged: CI/CD in the standard (green-before-merge; tag-triggered release; the human decides when to ship); architecture-touching merges pass the human + an ADR; a worktree dies with its task (0012).

## Consequences

The team runs on issues → branches → PRs → merges — the flow humans already converged on (0009), now literally reused. Everything durable is a GitHub artifact, so the cockpit is reconstructable for free (worklist = open issues + PRs) — no special rule needed. Executor cost scales with task difficulty instead of paying for a full session every time. Cost: the collaboration model is now large enough that it must be stated in full for workers, so core.md's every-session budget is relaxed (recorded as an amendment on 0007: hard ceiling ~3,000, kept lean) to carry roles, contract, and boundaries inline. The issue→PR flow binds work that earns a branch; trivial changes stay in-session.

**Amendment (2026-07-24, see 0022):** Decision point 2's small-work exemption ("a trivial in-repo change skips this — done in-session") is overturned — ceremony is now universal (every change rides a branch + PR + fresh review + CI). 0015's issues-dispatch / PRs-return / ladder-picks-executor core is unchanged.

**Amendment (2026-08-22):** Decision point 6 is stale on three counts, found while resolving issue
#122. *"injected `core.md`"* is superseded by 0019 — delivery is a forced read, not injection.
*"`aids/worker-brief.md`"* is superseded by 0031's rename to `reference/`. And the contrast itself —
a subagent gets the brief pasted, a separate session needs nothing more — understated what a separate
session's task can legitimately be: as unspecified as a subagent's task is not, per `core.md`'s own
routing rule. Measured, the brief carries operational detail `core.md` does not restate (a named
base, copying untracked files, vetting the issue at receipt, the flaky-check quarantine). Two things
now correct the third without touching point 6's text: `reference/worker-brief.md` is written to serve a
separate session reading it directly (issue #120), and `core.md`'s own pointer to it was strengthened
in the same pass (issue #122) so a separate session is told the brief adds detail rather than reading
the contrast as "you already have this."

**Amendment (2026-08-26, see 0039):** the cockpit this ADR's Decision names as "human + Claude"
is the human + the main session, whatever harness runs it. And the 2026-08-22 amendment's
load-bearing pointer (core.md's worker parenthetical routing a separate session to the brief) moved:
core.md now carries a neutral, third-person dispatch trigger — every dispatched worker receives, or
opens, the brief before acting — with the same effect and no self-classification.

**Amendment (2026-09-05, see 0045):** The 0039 amendment's harness-neutral cockpit is narrowed to the human and a Claude Code orchestrator. Codex participates only as a dispatched worker or reviewer process; worker identity and obligations still ride the dispatch brief.

**Amendment (2026-09-07, see 0047):** decision points 3 and 4 are overtaken. "Executor = the cheapest
ladder rung" retires with the ladder: dispatch is the default, and the executor is a purpose —
worker, reviewer, or a resolver as a worker assigned conflicts — times an implementation. And point
4's rebase clause is no longer conditioned on the author being ephemeral: the lane persists, and a
conflict found after handback always goes to a resolver dispatched into that affected lane, never
repaired by the orchestrator in its own worktree. The resolver's changed head takes a full review.
The cockpit, dispatch as an issue, and return as a PR stand as written; point 2's small-change
exemption had already gone to 0022.

**Amendment (2026-09-07, see 0049):** decision point 6's delivery contrast — a separate session
learns the rules from injected `core.md`, a subagent from a pasted brief — is retired. Static
context is one delivered artifact per role: an orchestrator's arrives by hook injection, and a
worker's or reviewer's arrives through dispatch, both naming the same operative role source. What
the point exists for — roles and boundaries written down so any executor knows them — is what the
split preserves.

**Amendment (2026-09-07, issue #279):** two corrections to the record; the decision is unchanged.
**Address.** The 2026-08-22 block's *"`reference/worker-brief.md` is written to serve a separate
session reading it directly (issue #120)"* names a page #235 reduced to a compatibility pointer and
#270 deleted. `reference/worker.md` is the operative source, and it carries the operational detail
that block measured — a named base, the copy-list, vetting the issue at receipt, the flaky-check
quarantine. Its reader is different, though: under 0045 and 0047 the standalone live-session lane is
outside the supported configuration (`reference/external-agent.md`; `docs/architecture.md` ch. 1), so
the page reaches a worker through dispatch rather than by being opened directly. The block's point —
that the brief adds detail `core.md` does not restate — is what the role split made structural.
**Status form.** The line above gains `Amends 0007` and `Amends 0009`, the form `reference/adr.md`
requires; both have announced `Amended by 0015 (2026-07-09)` since that date.

**Amendment (2026-09-11, see 0056):** The 0045 block's Claude-only cockpit is retired by 0056. One
Claude Code or Codex orchestrator uses the shared role source; Codex hosts use the existing process
dispatcher for governed lanes. Separate live-session worker lanes remain outside the configuration,
and dispatch still supplies worker identity.
