# 0037 — An agent writes in its repo, not across the human's filesystem

Status: Accepted (2026-08-25). Amends 0018 (its Gotchas kind gains a declared out-of-repo root; the
one-page fence and the three-kinds rule are unchanged).

## Context

`core.md`'s "Stay in your own repo" governs *other repositories*: a session works the repo it was
opened for and files an issue rather than editing a neighbour. The filesystem *between* repositories
had no rule at all — no page named `$HOME`, `~/Desktop`, `/tmp`, or any scratch location. So every
agent defaulted to the one place a shell starts, and the defaults accumulated.

An audit of one human's `$HOME` (issue #147) found nine agent-created entries, none the human's:
18 GB of model weights at `~/data/mage-vl` (an `hf download` that overrode HuggingFace's own cache to
build the path by hand), a 19 GB `~/services` deploy root, tool clones at `~/tools` and `~/labs`, a
perception log at `~/memory`, and deliverables dropped on the Desktop. The directory had been cleaned
once, three weeks earlier, and refilled. Cleaning is not the fix; the missing rule is.

Three of the nine are outside anything a method text can reach, and are scoped out rather than
counted: `~/memory` (OpenClaw — never a DevStandard session), three unattributable directories, and
six `~/.claude.json.tmp.*` files that are the harness's own atomic-write leftovers, not an agent
decision. The rule forecloses the path that produced the other six; it does not claim to have cleaned
a directory.

## Decision

**An agent writes to the repo it works in, to the scratch its session provides, or to a location a
tool's own documented convention or the repo's own docs name — and nowhere else. The human's home
directory and Desktop are theirs, exactly as another repository is.** The operative rule lives in
`reference/out-of-repo-writes.md`; `core.md`'s "Stay in your own repo" bullet gains the trigger.

Four calls in it were each forced by a review round and are recorded so a future session does not
reopen them:

**The line is conventional, not visible.** A tool's documented cache (`~/.cache/huggingface`, `~/.npm`)
is fine; `~/data/x` and `~/.mydata/x` are both an agent inventing a location, and the dot changes
nothing. An earlier draft drew the line at "visible", which permitted an invented dot-directory —
exactly the clutter the human objected to, which is not about what `ls` shows.

**"Invented" is the agent choosing the location itself.** A path the human handed over, or the repo's
own docs declare, is not invented — the same escape "Stay in your own repo" gives for another
repository. This reconciles "never under `$HOME`" with "a location the repo's docs name": a declared
`~/services` is named, not invented.

**The undeclared case is an ask, not a new axis, and it does not collide with the "act on your own"
default.** `core.md`'s ask-rule is exclusive ("Ask the human ONLY when…"), so a new "ask here" sentence
would lose to it under pressure — the failure two draft rounds hit from opposite directions. The fix
is to widen the rule's own third axis: "anything leaving the repo" now names a durable write onto the
human's filesystem with no place declared. A worker's equivalent is a new stop-list entry in
`reference/worker-brief.md`. **Rejected: adding the stop-list entry without the frequency defense** —
a stop-trigger for a frequent, cheap event is the one ADR 0026 Rejected (c) says gets ignored. It
survives because it is rare by construction (only a durable write with no tool default and no declared
root fires it) and **self-extinguishing**: the escalation's natural resolution is a declared root in
that repo's `CLAUDE.md`, after which every later write of that kind takes the silent declared-root
branch. The entry fires roughly once per repo per class of need, then never again.

**Disclosure is a discipline, not a gate — and the method says which.** An out-of-repo write leaves no
trace in a git diff when it is done by an ad hoc command, which is what every audited row was; merge
check 1 sees the diff and the report and nothing else, so it cannot catch an omission. A write the
diff *commits* — in a script, a Makefile, a CI step — is reviewable like any line, and the reviewer
prompt flags an invented location there. The rest is a disclosure the acting agent makes in the PR,
the same ungated shape ADR 0036 named for executor attribution; the reviewer asks where a write went
when a task plainly needed one, as a question, not a blocking finding.

Rejected: **a method-chosen default path** — the opinion the method refuses for deploy targets and
model tiers alike. Rejected: **routing the undeclared case through "touches top-level design"** — its
definition (structure, interfaces, dependencies, a quality goal) does not admit a filesystem location,
so a literal reader proceeds.

## Consequences

`core.md`'s "Stay in your own repo" bullet gains the filesystem half and the widened third ask-axis;
`reference/out-of-repo-writes.md` (new) carries the full rule; `reference/worker-brief.md` gains a
before-you-write trigger, a stop-list entry, and a disclosure line in Done; `reference/code-review-prompt.md`
gains a reviewer line, self-contained because a clean reviewer cannot open this file;
`reference/repo-claude-md.md`'s Gotchas gains a declared-root line, argued in its own prose as an
environment gotcha of the existing kind. `docs/architecture.md` §2 and `README.md`'s two enumerations
list the new file.

**Amendment to ADR 0018, below and on its status line**, records the fence ruling where 0018's own
history keeps such rulings, following the 2026-08-06 precedent (0030) of arguing new content fits an
existing kind rather than widening the fence to a new one.

What to watch: whether the disclosure duty is kept, given nothing enforces it — the same watch ADR
0036 set for attribution, and the same honest answer, that this is guidance and the method does not
pretend otherwise.
