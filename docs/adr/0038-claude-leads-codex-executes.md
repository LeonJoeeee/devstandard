# 0038 — Claude Code leads, Codex executes: one plugin, one branching hook, marker-scoped

Status: Accepted (2026-08-26). Amended by 0039 (2026-08-26). Amended by 0040 (2026-08-26). Amends 0036 (its executor-neutrality gains a settled default on the
Claude/Codex axis), 0019 (the SessionStart hook now branches by harness; the Claude branch and its
forced read of core.md are unchanged), 0007 (same scoping of the hook's description), and 0018 (its
AGENTS.md note is reframed: the fallback block is delivery, not memory). Supersedes nothing on main;
an earlier draft of this number recorded a symmetric either-side-may-lead design that was abandoned
before any merge — it survives in the branch history and in
`docs/specs/2026-08-25-devstandard-codex-adapter.md` (kept as `abandoned`), and this ADR is the
decision that replaced it.

*This ADR decides what DevStandard ships and how its projects are topologized — a reader in any
seeded project should take it as method.*

## Context

The human ruled (#148): on all these projects, **Claude Code is the main session — it plans,
dispatches, reviews, and merges; Codex is the executor.** The plugin installs on both harnesses, but
the sides carry different halves: Claude's is `core.md` entire; Codex's is only how to execute and
cooperate.

The evidence behind the ruling (#148/#153): every concrete community pairing surveyed runs
Claude-as-orchestrator, and a curated ecosystem directory lists no instance of the reverse; a
measured study (arXiv 2607.21656) finds Codex-writes/Claude-reviews the productive review direction
(+18.1pp) and the reverse harmful on average (−8.6pp; the harm mode — reviewers rewriting instead of
repairing — is structurally excluded by this method's non-writing check-1 reviewer, and its lesson
is kept as: an external reviewer's findings are verified, never auto-applied).

The delivery mechanics were settled by building, across nine adversarial challenge rounds run by
Codex itself (the full log is on #148); the load-bearing measurements, on `codex-cli 0.144.6` and
Claude Code 2.1.245:

- **Codex discovers a plugin's `hooks/hooks.json` and runs its SessionStart hook** after a one-time
  interactive trust confirmation; thereafter it fires flag-less in any directory, and trust survives
  plugin updates and script edits. (An earlier pilot concluded plugin hooks never fire; it had never
  walked the trust flow — an untrusted hook is skipped silently.)
- **The hook runtime discriminates the harness**: Codex sets `PLUGIN_DATA`/`PLUGIN_ROOT` and
  equal-valued `CLAUDE_`-prefixed aliases; Claude Code sets only its own pair. Equality of the two
  DATA values is the test — inheritance-resistant, since a contaminated environment inherits a
  *different* `PLUGIN_DATA`. This is a **version-scoped compatibility boundary**: any Claude or
  Codex release that changes its plugin-hook environment blocks support until the discriminator is
  re-measured.
- **Codex parses the Claude-style JSON hook output** — `additionalContext` reaches the model.
- Codex reads a repo's `AGENTS.md` chain natively; that channel is kept only as the **fallback**
  delivery where hooks are unavailable.

## Decision

**One plugin, one hook entry, one script.** `hooks/session-start` branches on the discriminator:
the **Claude branch is byte-identical to the pre-0038 hook** (ADR 0019's forced read of `core.md`);
the **Codex branch delivers the worker role** — and only inside a repo that has opted in with a
committed, regular-file `.devstandard` marker at its git toplevel; everywhere else it emits nothing.
An unidentifiable harness gets a visible warning and no instructions, never a blocked session.

**The worker role** lives in `reference/harness-codex.md` (size-gated): the main session is Claude
Code; a Codex session executes — implementation (with the placement validation, the
`worker-brief.md` and `CLAUDE.md` reads), review/challenge (read-only), or advice; never merge, tag,
or release; the record is GitHub. A direct human request without an issue runs a state machine that
opens and claims the issue, routes substantial changes to the main session, and puts eligible small
work in a dedicated worktree under `.claude/worktrees/` — never the opened checkout.

**Adoption is a committed change.** `scripts/codex-adopt` (in the plugin) writes the marker, the
`/.claude/worktrees/` gitignore entry, and — on request — a delimited, prepended `AGENTS.md`
fallback block; the marker doubles as the ownership manifest; the resulting diff rides a normal PR,
so git is the provenance and the undo, and a linked worktree created after adoption carries the
marker automatically. The dispatcher verifies the marker is committed on the branch it dispatches
onto. `CLAUDE.md` remains the operational-memory file on every harness — a Codex worker reads it
explicitly and writes back through its PR; `AGENTS.md` never carries memory.

**On the Claude side**, dispatching to an external agent now defaults to Codex where installed
(`core.md` "Who does the work"; `reference/external-agent.md` carries the adoption duty and the
verify-never-auto-apply stance). 0036's neutrality stands for every other tool.

## Consequences

- **The delivery asymmetry is stated, not hidden**: Claude delivery is automatic per install; Codex
  delivery is per-machine trust (once) plus per-repo adoption (a committed marker). A repo without
  the marker gives Codex sessions nothing — absent, not degraded.
- **Role obedience is model compliance** — the same bet ADR 0019 made for the Claude side — and is
  probed adversarially (a capability-controlled merge refusal test, re-run when the model or either
  CLI changes) rather than assumed.
- **Rollback has two named layers**: the delivery layer is additive (the branch is one `if`;
  reverting it restores the pre-0038 hook byte-for-byte; a repo unadopts via the same script); the
  policy migration — the operative clauses in `core.md`, `reference/worker-brief.md`,
  `reference/external-agent.md`, and this ADR's amendments — is a coordinated set, enumerated in
  `docs/specs/2026-08-26-claude-leads-codex-executes.md`.
- The `claude -p` reverse-dispatch mechanics and the Codex-as-main design were measured and are
  preserved on #148 for the day a ruling wants them; they ship nowhere.

**Amendment (2026-08-26, see 0039):** the identity and scoping this ADR decided — Codex as
permanent executor, the `.devstandard` marker, the adoption ceremony, the role-delivering hook
branch — are overturned by the human's correction the day this shipped: both harnesses receive the
same method, and worker identity is announced only by a dispatch brief. The measured delivery
mechanics recorded here (plugin-hook discovery, one-time trust, the discriminator, the
byte-identical Claude branch) stand and are what 0039 builds on.

**Amendment (2026-08-26, see 0040):** "dispatching to an external agent now defaults to Codex where installed" is no longer a soft, Claude-side default: at rung 2, on either harness, dispatched work goes to Codex where it is installed and a harness-native subagent only where the work especially suits one (`reference/external-agent.md`, "When a subagent, when Codex"); the standing model and effort are written once on that page. The adoption duty this sentence also named was already retired by 0039.
