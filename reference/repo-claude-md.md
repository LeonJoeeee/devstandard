# The repo-root `CLAUDE.md`

CI settles the project's commands — capture them while they're fresh: generate a repo-root `CLAUDE.md` — when there is something to put in it (below), as admitted by `reference/in-repo-writes.md` — one page hard max. Claude Code reads it natively at every session start in the repo, so it is the one place operational facts reach every clean-context worker automatically. Three kinds of content — plus one conditional fourth, and nothing else:

**`CLAUDE.md` stays the operational-memory file on every harness.** Its readers are the main session — whatever harness runs it — and every dispatched worker: a session whose harness doesn't auto-load it (Codex) reads it explicitly (`reference/harness-codex.md` instructs the read), and everyone writes discoveries back here through their PR. Never move this file's content into `AGENTS.md` — memory there reaches nobody the method relies on.

- **Commands** — install, test, run (the same ones CI just encoded);
- **Environment gotchas** — ports in use, services that must be up, local-vs-CI differences;
- **Untracked files a new worktree must copy** — the allowlist `reference/worktree-lifecycle.md` copies from (`.env`, keys, local config).

A cache or deploy root outside the tree is an environment gotcha of exactly this kind only when the
root itself already existed as an authority for this project's files or the human chose it. Recording
that place relays the authority so a clean-context worker does not invent another
(`reference/where-it-goes.md`); a `CLAUDE.md` line added in the same change never authorises a root the
change invented. It belongs under Gotchas, not as a new kind of content.

One conditional fourth item — the fence's only exception: a `## Record language` line, when the repo's durable record is not English (core.md's rule). It sits here because a clean-context worker must see it natively; the reasoning behind the choice goes in that repo's ADR log, not here. Its absence means English.

Generate it only when the project actually has some of that to say. A file that merely transcribes what CI already encodes, or that would stand empty under every heading with no record language to declare, is noise every later session pays to read — skip it, and let the first real command, gotcha, copy-list line or record-language declaration create it through the same write-back lane.

It grows one line at a time: whoever merges a task that exposed a command, environment gotcha, worktree copy-list entry, or record-language declaration writes it back (the worktree checklist's Death step) through a short-branch PR like any other change. The writer enforces the 30-line cap (roughly twice the template below) at write time: a write-back that would cross it also drops the line it most clearly supersedes, or otherwise the stalest gotcha — never a separate cleanup pass. Architecture, decisions, rules, and task state never go here — the template's last line is the fence.

# <Project> — repo notes for agents

## Commands
- install: <command>
- test: <command>
- run: <command>

## Gotchas
- <port / service / local-vs-CI difference worth one line>
- <cache or deploy root already assigned to this project or chosen by the human, e.g. ~/.cache/foo or /srv/app — this line relays that place; it does not authorise a root this change invented>

## New worktree: copy these untracked files
- <path>   (or: none — everything load-bearing is tracked)

Architecture: see docs/architecture.md — never duplicated here. Decisions: docs/adr/ unless the architecture doc points elsewhere. Tasks: GitHub issues.
