# How to write ADRs

Read this at project start (to seed the log) and whenever a significant decision lands. An ADR records **one decision and its why**, dated, one page — so no future session burns cost re-deriving "why was it done this way".

## When to write one (and when not)

Two axes — either one fires:
- the decision **touches top-level design** (structure, interfaces, dependencies, a key quality goal), or
- it is **costly to reverse**.

Skip: trivial single-person choices, temporary workarounds/spikes, anything already covered by an existing ADR or the architecture doc. Litmus test: *would a future session burn real cost re-deriving why this was chosen?* No → no ADR.

Admission test when unsure: a decision earns an ADR only if its **cost of change is high** — it touches fundamental structures, or its effects scatter across the codebase instead of staying local to one component. A log that records everything protects nothing: if every decision is architectural, no decision is architectural.

ADRs are the natural by-product of asking the human: when a change gets the human's approval because it touches top-level design, that approval gets an ADR in the same merge.

## Mechanics

Write the ADR at decision time from the actual discussion; if the real alternatives considered cannot be recalled, say so rather than inventing plausible ones.

- Files by default: `docs/adr/NNNN-kebab-title.md` — or the established location an adopted repository uses — four digits, sequential, zero-padded, never reused. Seed the log at project start with `0000-record-architecture-decisions.md` (the ADR saying this project uses ADRs, containing the trigger rules above).
- **Claim the number when you write the ADR, after checking it is free** — and check *unmerged* work too, not just what has already merged: an open branch, an open PR, or an issue that reserved one all hold a number before it exists in the tree. **Take the next number above the highest claimed anywhere,** never the lowest one free — backfilling files an August decision between two June ones. Gaps are fine; the numbers only order the log. **Record which number you took and what you checked it against in the PR description,** so check 1 can verify it like any other claim.
- **Supersede, never edit — but dated amendments are legal.** A changed decision = a NEW ADR stating "Supersedes NNNN"; the old one's status flips to "Superseded by MMMM". Original text is never rewritten. For a *partial* supersession (the core call stands, one detail was overtaken) or a *factual correction*, append a dated block instead, leaving the body immutable: `**Amendment (YYYY-MM-DD, see NNNN):** …` when an ADR amends this one, and otherwise `**Amendment (YYYY-MM-DD, <what caused it>):** …` — or `**Amendment (YYYY-MM-DD):** …` with nothing to cite.
- Statuses: `Accepted`, `Superseded by NNNN`, and `Amended by NNNN` (which sits alongside Accepted). The new ADR carries `Supersedes NNNN` or `Amends NNNN (<what it amends>)` in its own status line. An amendment whose citation is not an *amending* ADR carries `Amended (date)` without a number.
- **Every block must appear in the status line, in the matching form:** `(date, see NNNN)` pairs with `Amended by NNNN`; any other citation — a commit, an issue, a PR, an ADR that merely *caused* the change — pairs with `Amended (date)`. An amendment the index misses is one a reader never finds.
- One decision per file — separate files keep parallel sessions conflict-free and let agents read only what's relevant (`ls <decision-log-path>` is the index; filenames carry the summary).

## Template

```markdown
# NNNN — <decision in one line>

Status: Accepted (<date>)

## Context
<the situation and forces; what made this a real decision>

## Decision
<what was decided, concretely. If real alternatives existed,
one line each on what was rejected and why>

## Consequences
<what gets better, what it costs, what to watch>
```

Lands in the target repo under `docs/adr/` by default; an adopted repository's established convention
may supply another location, which `docs/architecture.md` declares (`reference/in-repo-writes.md`).
