"""Every ADR amendment block must be announced by its status line, in the matching form.

`reference/adr.md` states the rule; this checks it. Run from the repo root.

    (date, see NNNN)  ->  `Amended by NNNN`, dated or not
    any other citation, or none  ->  `Amended (date)`

"Any other citation" is deliberate: a block may cite a commit, an issue, a PR, or an ADR
that *caused* the change without deciding anything about this one (`caused by NNNN`). None
of those is an amending ADR, so all pair with the citation-free status form.

Two things this does NOT do, both on purpose:

  * It does not police header *style*. A block written before the sanctioned form existed
    (`**Amendment DATE (issue #NN):**`) is parsed for its date and held to the same
    announcement rule — because the alternative is editing an already-merged block, and
    `reference/code-review-prompt.md` ships "a rewritten ADR body is Critical" with no
    carve-out. Recognise the old shape; never rewrite it.
  * It does not resolve the `Status:` line — it resolves the `Status:` *block*, to the next
    blank line. Four ADRs wrap it across three or four physical lines, and assuming one
    line has already caused a real defect here (an amendment spliced mid-sentence).

A header must begin its line (optionally blockquoted). Header scanning skips backtick and
tilde fenced regions, so a template quoted inside prose or fenced code is not mistaken for
a real amendment — this repo writes ADRs *about* ADR conventions.
