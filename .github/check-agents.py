"""Check the shipped Claude-native role carriers (issues #201, #334, #339, #402, #409).

`agents/worker.md` is hand-authored frontmatter plus a GENERATED body, because the Claude harness
loads an agent definition's body as the subagent's system prompt, and that is what carries the role
on the default `--implementation claude` path without a read (ADR 0060).

**The concatenation rule: the worker's body is the exact bytes of `reference/worker.md` followed by
the exact bytes of `reference/harness-claude.md`, in that order, with nothing between them.** The
shared contract page and the Claude harness page are separate sources (ADR 0061) and separate
reads; the definition body is the one carrier that delivers both to a Claude worker and survives its
compaction. Both stay hand-written; only the body is generated. Run this gate with `--write` to
regenerate it in place; without it the gate only checks, so CI fails on a body that has drifted from
either source.
